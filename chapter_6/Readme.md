 __Places where a string is inside a string <br>__

   1. x = "there are #{types_of_people} type of people <br>
   2. y = "Those who know #{binary} and those who #{do_not}.<br>
   3. puts "I said: #{x}" <br>
   4. puts "I also said: #{y}" <br>

 I do not think that the joke_evaluation variable is a string <br>
 inside a string because the value of 'hilarious' isa string.<br>
 I think it is a boolean value? So, he was *not*  lying. <br>


  'w' and 'e' are variables, and can be assigned to either a <br>
  string of characters, or integers. Adding them together creates <br>
  a longer string because it is a similar idea when you add two <br>
  integers together. It's just adding the strings and returning a longer string. <br>


When changing the strings from single to double quotes, it does not work. <br>
That is because interpolation # {variable_name} only works inside double <br>
quotes. But it does work when you are simply writing out strings, as we did <br>
with the 'w' and 'e' variables.
