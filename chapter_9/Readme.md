Q: What does \n do inside "double quotes?"

A: It adds a new line after the string. \n is also called a 'new line character'

Ex.

    puts " the backslash \\n\n adds a new line\n to whatever\n came before it\n see?"

And the output would look like this:

 the backslash \n
 adds a new line
 to whatever
 came before it
 see?
