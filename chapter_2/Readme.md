### *Octothorpe Invasion!*


The 'octothorpe' character is also known as a number sign, or hash tag.
This character says to Ruby "Ignore what comes after me"
It is used to comment out code, or temporarily disable code.
ex.

Ruby will ignore anything after the # sign.

Unless it is part of a string "#{Ruby will run this}" but not #"#{this}"

A good [shortcut](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/help/commenting-and-uncommenting-blocks-of-code.html) for RubyMine<br>
 to comment out a whole line of code is by pressing Command+Slash. <br>
 For a whole block the short cut is Alt + Command + Slash
