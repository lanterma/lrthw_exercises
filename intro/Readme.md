> What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

  1. *Reading and Writing*

      What do you learn in pre-school, and kindergarden? Reading and writing.
     Our entire way of communication is based on letters and numbers, and you must learn how
     to communicate with them. It is integral to learn the basics, and how they go together
     to create meaning. Same with programming, there is so much emphasis on the basics that
     without them, going any deeper would just confuse and frustrate you. <br>

  2. *Attention to detail* <br>

      If you are not detail oriented, how will you catch a missing quote at the end of a string?
      How will you know that curly brackets need to be closed? How will you ever get proper
      spacing right? Attention to detail is more than just syntax, it's how the whole code
      looks and is understood by someone else.

  3. *Spotting differences* <br>

       Spotting differences can help when you are stuck on a practice problem, or just stuck
       in general. You look at the example code, and then yours. Is the spacing the same? <br>
       Are all the indentations right? <br> How are they different? <br> Can you see any missing
       methods? Spotting differences plays heavily on the ability and dedication you have to
       detail. It can also help you look at a micro and macro level.

 
> Why do you need to not copy and paste?

  If you copy and paste, it's a waste. A waste of time, mouse clicks, and ultimately cheats your brain
  from ever being fully familiar with how to use your pinky to hit the 'pipes' | |. It also robs
  the portion of the repetition in the exercises. I mean, sure. Copying and pasting multiple times
  is in a sense repeating an action, but it's a cheating action. And who wants to be a cheater?


> Why is Practice and Persistence important? <br>

  I don't know who said it first, but practice makes perfect. You have to repeat, repeat, and repeat
  again if you ever want to wear neural pathways in your brain. Your brain is like a muscle, if
  you repeat and repeat tasks, it remembers how to do them. And in time, it takes less and less
  mental effort to accomplish tasks. Think about tying a shoe. The first time i did it, it probably
  took me a day. Now, I can tie both shoes in under 30 seconds. Boom, the glory of repetition.
