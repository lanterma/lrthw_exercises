I am not the best at working through the math portion <br>
and want to know the best way to write a conversion <br>
equation.

I am looking into ways to ask for information, and <br>
then print that information into the conversion string <br>
to get the desired output.

I will add more to this once i have done research into <br>
how to use 'gets' in this way.
